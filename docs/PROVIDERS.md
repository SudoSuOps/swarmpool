# Providers

Providers are sovereign operators running local, air-gapped compute.

There are no accounts, no schedulers, and no required uptime.

---

## Provider Capabilities

Providers:
- watch Swarmpool
- choose jobs
- select SOLO or PPL per job
- execute inference locally
- submit proofs
- earn at epoch settlement

Providers may remain idle at any time.

---

## Joining

```bash
swarm init --provider miner.yourname.eth
```

No approval. No lock-in.

## Canon Rule

> Providers choose when to work. Proof determines payment.

---

Swarm provides verifiable inference infrastructure.
Models, data, and outcomes remain the responsibility of their operators.
