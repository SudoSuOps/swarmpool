# Execution Modes & Economics

Swarm supports two execution modes.

---

## SOLO

- Winner takes the miner pool
- Higher variance
- Higher upside

Example:
- Job reward: $0.10
- Miner pool (75%): $0.075
- Winner earns: $0.075

---

## PPL (Pay-Per-Load)

- Proportional payout by compute contribution
- Lower variance

Example:
- Miner pool: $0.075
- Miner A (40%): $0.030
- Miner B (35%): $0.02625
- Miner C (25%): $0.01875

## Payout Split

| Pool | Percentage |
|------|------------|
| Miner Pool | 75% |
| Hive Ops | 25% |

Dust (sub-microunit remainders) flows to Hive Ops.

## Canon Rule

> SOLO rewards speed.
> PPL rewards contribution.

Swarm provides verifiable inference infrastructure.
Models, data, and outcomes remain the responsibility of their operators.
