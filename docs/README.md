# Swarm Documentation

This documentation describes the Swarm protocol, its components, and how sovereign compute providers participate.

Swarm is a **proof-of-compute inference protocol** designed for air-gapped, operator-owned infrastructure.

## Core Concepts
- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Swarmpool](SWARMPOOL.md)
- [Providers](PROVIDERS.md)
- [Execution Modes](ECONOMICS.md)

## Protocol & Security
- [Signing & Identity](SIGNING.md)
- [IPFS Layout](POOL_LAYOUT.md)
- [ENS & Identity](IDENTITY.md)

## Operations
- [CLI Reference](CLI.md)
- [Merlin (Epoch Controller)](MERLIN.md)
- [SwarmLedger](LEDGER.md)
- [SwarmOrb](ORB.md)

## Canon Rule

> If it is not written here and signed on IPFS, it is not part of the protocol.

---

Swarm provides verifiable inference infrastructure.
Models, data, and outcomes remain the responsibility of their operators.
