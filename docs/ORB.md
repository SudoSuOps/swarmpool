# SwarmOrb

SwarmOrb is the observation and intelligence layer.

**ENS:** `swarmorb.eth`

---

## Role

- **Observe** — Read Swarmpool and SwarmLedger
- **Interpret** — Analyze patterns and trends
- **Signal** — Surface health and capacity indicators

---

## What Orb Does

- Network health monitoring
- Congestion detection
- Capacity utilization signals
- Provider performance metrics
- Epoch analytics
- Historical trend analysis

---

## What Orb Does Not Do

- Execute compute
- Settle payments
- Assign work
- Control providers
- Modify state

---

## Failure Mode

If SwarmOrb goes offline:
- Swarmpool continues
- Providers continue
- Settlement continues
- Nothing breaks

Orb is read-only. The protocol does not depend on it.

---

## Canon Rule

> Orb may advise. It may never command.

---

Swarm provides verifiable inference infrastructure.
Models, data, and outcomes remain the responsibility of their operators.
